# Zeebe Knative / Cloud Events Worker

This project focus in providing a bridge between Zeebe + BPMN to Knative and Cloud Events to provide Cloud Events orchestration using Zeebe Workflows. 



# Service Task Properties

Properties
- HOST
- TYPE
- MODE: 
  - EMIT_ONLY: 
  - WAIT_FOR_CLOUD_EVENT: 
- WAIT_TYPE: Cloud Event Type to wait 

The worker has two modes:
- EMIT ONLY: It will emit a Cloud Event and complete the Job
- WAIT FOR CLOUD EVENT: It will wait to receive Cloud Event with a specific Type which will be correlated by the workflow and job key to complete the Service Task. 
 

# Endpoints

The worker expose HTTP Endpoints to recieve Cloud Events that can be propagated to workflows. 

- / POST - > Receive Cloud Event via HTTP that will map to a Job
- /message POST -> Receive a Cloud Event that will be forwarded as a BPMN Message for an Intermediate Catch Event 


# Examples

## EMIT and WAIT

> zbctl deploy emit-wait.bpmn --insecure
>
> zbctl create instance EMIT_WAIT  --insecure
>
> curl -X POST localhost:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ce-Id: 536808d3" -H "Ce-Type: <WAIT_TYPE>" -H "Ce-Source: curl" -H "Ce-Subject: <WORKFLOW_KEY>:<WORKFLOW_INSTANCE_KEY>:<JOB_KEY>"  -d '{"name":"salaboy"}'  -v
>

## EMIT and CONTINUE:
> zbctl deploy emit-and-continue.bpmn --insecure
> zbctl create instance EMIT_AND_CONTINUE --variables "{\"myVarId\" : \"123\"}" --insecure
>  curl -X POST localhost:8080/message -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ce-Id: 536808d3" -H "Ce-Type: Cloud Event Response" -H "Ce-Source: curl" -H "CorrelationKey: 123" -d '{"name":"salaboy"}'  -v 


## TICKETS
Deploy workflow
> zbctl deploy tickets.bpmn --insecure

Register Tickets.Purchase event to Start Workflow
> curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflows -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cloudEventType" : "Tickets.Purchase", "workflowKey" : "2251799813690282"}'

Send Tickets.Purchase to start a workflow
> curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/workflow -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ce-Id: 536808d33" -H "Ce-Type: Tickets.Purchase" -H "Ce-Source: curl" -d '{"sessionId":"5" }'
